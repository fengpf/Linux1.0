This is a packet used for debugging Linux kernel 0.11 by using Bochs
and gdb. In the X window environment, open two terminal consoles, and 
in one terminal change working directory to linux-gdb/ and run "./run".
In the other terminal window change to directory linux-gdb/linux/ and 
run the command "gdb tools/system". For details, see the associated ebook. 


BTW: If you comment out the following line in the bochsrc-fd1-gdb.bxrc:

gdbstub: enabled=1, port=1234, text_base=0, data_base=0, bss_base=0

the Linux 0.11 system will be run in normal case.
