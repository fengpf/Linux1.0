A integrated bootimage file 'bootroot-0.11', which also contains a simple 
small root file system. That is to say you can boot and run the Linux 0.11 
system with only one disk image file. For the theory related, read the 
Linux 0.11 kernel source files kernel/blk_drv/ramdisk.c and fs/super.c

Files descriptions
==================

bootroot-0.11	The bootimage file containning a little rootfs with 1024KB
		in size and started from diskblock 256.
		
bochsrc-rd.bxrc	The bochs configuration file for the above image file.

parts/		This directory contains two files, bootimage-rd and 
		rootimage-small, used to assemble and create the 
		bootroot image file. 
		
Simple description for creating the bootroot image file.
========================================================
1. Copy the two files in parts/ directory into the linux-0.11-devel-XXXXXX/.
   Use bochs imagetools or WinImage to create a empty 1.44MB image file and 
   named it as 'bootroot-0.11'
2. Run the linux-0.11-devel sytem in bochs. Input the following two files 
   into the hd image using the metohed mentioned in chapter 14 in the book.
       bootimage-rd  
       rootimage-small 
   Notice that, you can also built these two files by your own. To geneate the
   bootimage-rd image file, modify the Makefile in /usr/src/linux. Change the 
   two line as bellow:
       RAMDISK = -DRAMDISK=2048
       ROOT_DEV= FLOPPY
   recompile the kernel and the Image file generated is exactly the bootimage-rd
   image file. To crate the small rootfs image file, read the contents relating
   root fs creation in chapter 14.
3. Click the diskette drive icon on the bochs' tool bar. Configuring the drive
   A (/dev/fd0) to be the empty image file bootroot-0.11 created in the first step. 
4. Using the folloing commands to create the runnable bootroot image file.
   dd if=bootimage-rd of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 
   dd if=rootimage-small of=/dev/fd0 bs=1024 seek=256
5. Exit linux-0.11-devel system and boot with the bootroot-0.11. Done!



BTW:
We need bochs 2.1.1 or above to run the experiment. The bochs simluation 
system can be download from the following webste freely.
